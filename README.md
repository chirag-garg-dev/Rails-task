Navigate to the backend directory.
Install dependencies using bundle install.
Set up the database using rails db:create and rails db:migrate.
Start the Rails server on port 3000 using rails server or rails s.
Frontend React Project: This project is built using React and serves as the frontend for the application. To set up the React project:

Clone the repository.
Navigate to the frontend directory.
Install dependencies using npm install or yarn install.
Start the React server using npm start or yarn start.
After setting up both projects and starting the servers, the Rails server will be running on port 3000 by default, and the React server will typically run on a different port (e.g., 3001). You can then access the application through the browser.](https://github.com/chirag-garg-dev/react-rails-task-crud
